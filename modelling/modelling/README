-> M: modelling mode, 
		in modelling mode, press P to start drawing polygon (click to plot a vertex)
		after creating all the vertices, click P again to create the full polygon and add it 
		to the current loaded model.

	* in modelling mode, rotations will be about the centre, not about the centroid 
	* to rotate about centroid, first press 'R', which moves centroid to origin, then rotate.

-> P: to start and stop drawing polygons in modelling mode.
		* if no. of points plotted is < 3, then no polygon will be formed.
		
-> I: inspection mode
	* as given in problem statement

-> V: to toggle axes planes (XY, YZ, ZX planes) (only in modelling mode)
-> C: to toggle frontal plane

-> T: to draw on XZ plane 
-> Y: to draw on XY plane
-> U: to draw on YZ plane  

-> K: save model
-> L: load model
